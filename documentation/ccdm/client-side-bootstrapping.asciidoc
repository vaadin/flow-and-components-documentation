WARNING: CCDM is a temporary internal name that might change in the definitive release. This documentation covers the concepts and API as it's being implemented in alpha or pre-beta period, and it might change without any advise.

= Client-side Bootstrapping

Client-side bootstrapping mode is not enabled by default. To turn it on, you need to provide the property `vaadin.clientSideMode=true` as a system property or maven plugin property while building/running an application, e.g. running in dev-mode with client-side bootstrapping enabled: `mvn jetty:run -Dvaadin.clientSideMode`. It can be also be provided as a servlet container deployment property with the name `clientSideMode`.

=== Bootstrap Page Template [[bootstrap-page-template]]

In this `clientSideMode`, instead of generating the full HTML content of the host application page, the server uses `frontend/index.html` file as a template to generate the bootstrap page. It processes the template and injects the following additional information:

  - `<base href='./relative/to/root'>`: Flow calculates the relative path from the current request path to the root path of the application. So that all the relative links in the template should work correctly.

  - Bundled script: Flow adds the bundled script which is generated from `frontend/index.js` (or `frontend/index.ts` if you prefer to develop in TypeScript) by webpack (the module bundler used in Flow). Therefore, in the template `frontend/index.html`, there is no need to include the `index.js` (or `index.ts`) script manually. That will be done automatically by the server when serving the bootstrap page.

By using this approach, you can optimize your application to load the minimal content to be displayed to users at the first load. This might reduce the first-loading time compared to the old bootstrapping method which loads a full Vaadin application on the first request. As a result, the first request will load promptly ant it will boost the first interaction experience.

NOTE: The frontend directory can be customized by providing the property `vaadin.frontend.frontend.folder` when running the Maven goals `prepare-frontend`  or `build-frontend` from `vaadin-maven-plugin`.

==== Default Bootstrap Template and Entry Point

If the `index.html` or `index.ts` (and `index.js`) in the frontend folder are missing, `vaadin-maven-plugin` generates a default corresponding file in the `target` folder. The generated files bootstrap and load the application using server-side routing. You can take control of these files by creating them in the `frontend` folder. The default content of the files are as following:

.Default `index.html`
[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <!-- Polyfills for the Web Component APIs are required to use Web Components
    in the browsers that do not support these APIs natively (e.g. IE11) -->
  <script src="./VAADIN/build/webcomponentsjs/webcomponents-loader.js" defer></script>
  <!-- index.ts is included here automatically (either by the dev server or during the build) -->
</head>
<body>
</body>
</html>
----

.Default `index.ts`
[source,javascript]
----

import { Flow } from '@vaadin/flow-frontend/Flow';

const flow = new Flow({
  // relative path to `projectDir/target/frontend/flow-generated-imports.js`
  // @ts-ignore
  imports: () => import('../target/frontend/flow-generated-imports.js')
});
// Let the flow-server control the application
flow.start();
----

NOTE: Follow <<typescript-support#, this link>> for more information about TypeScript support. To mix client-side and server-side routes, you need to install and configure `vaadin-router` as described in <<quick-start-guide#, Quick Start Guide>>

In case you have an `index.ts` in your frontend folder but there is no `tsconfig.json` in your project root, `vaadin-maven-plugin` also generates one.

.Default `tsconfig.json`
[source,json]
----
// This TypeScript configuration file is generated by vaadin-maven-plugin.
// This is needed for TypeScript compiler to compile your TypeScript code in the project.
// It is recommended to commit this file to the VCS.
// You might want to change the configurations to fit your preferences
// For more information about the configurations, please refer to http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html

=== Modifying the Bootstrap Page on Runtime

Before sending the bootstrap page response to the browser, the content can be modified via a `ClientIndexBootstrapListener`. An implementation of the listener should be added via `ServiceInitEvent` when a VaadinService is initialized. Take a look on the <<../advanced/tutorial-service-init-listener#,ServiceInitListener tutorial>> on how to configure it.

Here is an example implementation of `ClientIndexBootstrapListener` to add additional meta tags into the head of the bootstrap page:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomBootstrapPageListener implements
            ClientIndexBootstrapListener {

    @Override
    public void modifyBootstrapPage(
            ClientIndexBootstrapPage clientIndexBootstrapPage) {
        Document document = clientIndexBootstrapPage.getDocument();

        Element head = document.head();

        head.appendChild(createMeta(document, "og:title", "The Rock"));
        head.appendChild(createMeta(document, "og:type", "video.movie"));
        head.appendChild(createMeta(document, "og:url",
                "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117500/"));
        head.appendChild(createMeta(document, "og:image",
                "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/rock.jpg"));
    }

    private Element createMeta(Document document, String property,
            String content) {
        Element meta = document.createElement("meta");
        meta.attr("property", property);
        meta.attr("content", content);
        return meta;
    }
}

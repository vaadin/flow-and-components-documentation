If you want to create an add-on which is not a UI component, e.g. a data provider, you can still use the same component starter described in <<<dummy/../integrating-a-web-component>>>. Leave the default web component URL in the starter form, download the project and delete
1. The webjar dependency
2. The UI component class

You now have a generic project which can be used for any add-on purposes and which supports Directory deployment using
```
mvn clean install -Pdirectory
```

= Creating Another type of Add-on

If you want to create an add-on which is not a UI component, e.g. a data provider, you can still use the same component starter described in <<integrating-a-web-component#,Integrating a Web Component>>.
Leave the default web component URL in the starter form, download the project and delete:

1. The `@NpmPackage` and `@JsModule` annotations
2. The UI component class

You now have a generic project which can be used for any add-on purposes and which supports Directory deployment using

[source, sh]
----
mvn clean install -Pdirectory

= Deploying to Cloud Providers

Vaadin applications are standard Java Web Applications, and as such can be deployed on most cloud services that support Java applications. Since Vaadin is a stateful framework, it does require sticky sessions be enabled on the server.

Some providers will require a pre-built JAR or WAR file, while some allow you to deploy e.g. directly from GitHub. For all cases we recommend you read the <<.tutorial-production-mode-basic#, introductory chapter>> of this section before proceeding with the linked tutorials.

Here are a few tutorials for how to deploy our app onto different environments:

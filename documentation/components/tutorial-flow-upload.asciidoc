= Upload

== Overview

`Upload` component allows uploading single or multiple files with drag and drop support.

== Using Upload

`Upload` component allows to upload multiple files at once.
Its method `setMaxFiles` may be used to limit maximum number of files to upload.
A `Receiver` instance should be specified to receive uploaded data.
Here is the simplest case when you want to allow to upload only one file: 

[source, java]
----
FileBuffer fileBuffer = new FileBuffer();
Upload upload = new Upload(fileBuffer);
----

The uploaded data will be stored for you in a file on the filesytem and 
you may get the data from the file using the `getInputStream()` method.

If you want to allow upload multiple files then you should use a `MultiFileReceiver`.
Here is an example:

[source, java]
----
MultiFileBuffer multiFileBuffer = new MultiFileBuffer();
Upload upload = new Upload(multiFileBuffer);
----

Here the `MultiFileBuffer` class is a ready-made implementation of `MultiFileReceiver`.
Similary to the single file case the data will be stored in files on the filesystem
and you may get the date using a file name and the `getInputStream(String)` method.

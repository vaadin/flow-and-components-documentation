= Disabled Components

It's possible to disable/enable a `Component` using its `setEnabled` method. This is
a basic feature described in <<tutorial-component-basic-features#,Component Basic Features>> tutorial.
This tutorial is about various aspects of using it.

== Disabled Container

Normally we want to disable every descendant component in the disabled container.
That what happens with the container by default.

== Override default disabled behavior

By default disabled components doesn't allow any user interaction from the client side.
Complicated (composite) components sometimes should stay partly functional even in disabled state.

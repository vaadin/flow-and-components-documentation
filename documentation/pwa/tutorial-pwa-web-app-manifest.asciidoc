= Web App Manifest

When the @PWA annotation is used, Flow will automatically create a web app
manifest file with the name manifest.webmanifest. It has the following
properties that can be customized:

- *name* - The name of the application, set in `@PWA` -property *name*.
- *short_name* - The short name (max 12 characters) of the application. This is used
on device home screen where there's limited amount of space. Set in `@PWA` -property *shortName*.
- *description* - The description for application. The default value is is empty string.
 Set in `@PWA` -property *description*.
- *display* - Defines the preferred display mode for application. The default value
is *standalone*.  Set in `@PWA` -property *display*.
- *background_color* - The background color of application. The default value is "*#f2f2f2*".
Set in `@PWA` -property *backgroundColor*.
- *theme_color* - The theme color of application. The default value is "*#ffffff*".
Set in `@PWA` -property *themeColor*.
- *scope* -  Defines the navigation scope of this website's context. This restricts
what web pages can be viewed while the manifest is applied. Cannot be changed
with `@PWA` -annotation. Value is set to the context path of application.
- *start_url* - The start url where to navigate when application is launched from
installed app (home screen). The default value is an empty string `""`, which
points to the default route target for the application (marked with `@Route("")`).
Set in `@PWA` -property *startPath*.
- *icons* - Automatically created from icons.

== Renaming manifest

The default name of web app manifest is "*manifest.webmanifest*", but it can be changed
with `@PWA` -property *manifestPath*.
```
@PWA(name = "My Progressive Web Application", shortName="MyPWA", manifestPath = "manifest.json")
```

== Overriding generated manifest

To override generated manifest file, place custom manifest with the name defined
in the *manifestPath* property.

For example, create a custom manifest file and copy it to:
```
src/main/webapp/manifest.webmanifest
```

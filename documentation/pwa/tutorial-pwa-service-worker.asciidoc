= Service Worker


When the @PWA annotation is used, Flow will generate a simple service worker
automatically during application startup. Service caches resources:
offline fallback page, icons and user defined offline resources.
Service worker also handles simple navigation in offline by serving the offline
page.

Note that the service worker can only respond to full navigation events, like
refresh or direct navigation to an url.

The service worker uses https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/[Google Workbox]
for caching resources. Needed workbox files are served by Flow, from directory
“_VAADIN/resources/workbox/_”.

== Custom cached resources

To get custom files to be cached automatically by the service worker, add those
to `@PWA` -property *offlineResources*.

For example, if wanted to cache *styles/offline.css*, *img/offline.jpg* and *js/jquery.js*
[source,java]

@PWA(name = "My Progressive Web Application",
     shortName = "MyPWA",
     offlineResources = { "styles/offline.css",
         "js/jquery.js", "img/offline.jpg" })

== Overriding generated service worker

To override generated service worker, copy a custom service worker to web application
folder, named as "*sw.js*".

```
src/main/webapp/sw.js
```

[NOTE]
Overriding service worker means that offline support and resource caching must be
done in that custom service worker. A good template for custom service worker can
be achieved by copying generated service worker from browser resources.

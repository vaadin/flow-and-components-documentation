= Embedded Application Push Configuration

You may configure and enable Push in your embedded application.
See <<../advanced/tutorial-push-configuration#,Server Push Configuration>> tutorial 
for Push overview.

There are two ways to configure Push for the embedded application: use 
`@Push` annotation for your `WebComponentExporter` class or declare it
on the servlet level. You can see how to do it on the servlet level in the
mentioned tutorial.

Similarly to declaring `@Theme` annotation described in 
<<tutorial-webcomponent-theming#,Theming an Embedded Application>> tutorial, 
you may declare `@Push` annotation for `WebComponentExporter` class:

[source, java]
----
@Tag("push-component")
@Push
public class PushComponentExporter implements WebComponentExporter<Div> {
----

`@Push` annotation declaration has the same limitation as `@Theme` annotation:
it's not possible to declare several different `@Push` annotations for different
exporter classes. An exception will be thrown otherwise during the application
startup. It's enough to configure Push only for one exporter.

= Limitations in Embedded Application

Some features are not available for embedded applications. Here is what you should
be aware of:
* Navigation and routing features are not available for embedded applications. 
This means there is no sense in annotating your classes with `@Route` annotation: 
you will not be able to navigate to the route target. 
It implies also that you should avoid using router link 
(via the `RouterLink` class or any other custom way).
* Only one `Theme` annotation may be specified. This is explained in the <<tutorial-webcomponent-theming#,Theming an Embedded Application>>  tutorial.
* Only one `Push` annotation may be used. This is explained in the <<tutorial-webcomponent-push#,Embedded Application Push Configuration>>  tutorial.

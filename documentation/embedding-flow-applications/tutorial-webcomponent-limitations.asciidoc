= Limitations in Embedded Application

Some functionality doesn't work in an embedded application. Here is what you should
be aware of:
* Navigation and routing doesn't work in the embedded application. It means that it has no sense to 
annotate your classes with `@Route` annotation: you will not be able to navigate 
to the route target. It implies also that you should avoid using router link 
(via the `RouterLink` class or any other custom way).
* Only one `Theme` annotation may be specified. This is explained in the <<tutorial-webcomponent-theming#,Theming an Embedded Application>>  tutorial.
* Only one `Push` annotation may be used. This is explained in the <<tutorial-webcomponent-push#,Embedded Application Push Configuration>>  tutorial.

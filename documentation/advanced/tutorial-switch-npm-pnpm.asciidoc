= Differences between NPM and PNPM

Starting from  Vaadin Platform 14.2 `pnpm` tool is used as the default package manager instead of `npm`.
https://pnpm.js.org/[pnpm] uses shared repository available for any project which allows to reduce
packages download time.

If `pnpm` is not installed globally the framework will install it locally using `npm`.
`package-lock.json` which is used by `npm` may be incompatible with `pnpm` and it's 
removed automatically if `pnpm` is used. `pnpm` uses `pnpm-lock.yaml` 
file instead of `package-lock.json`. This means that any dependency configurations 
should move to `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

Another thing which is incompatible with `npm` in older versions is `package.json` file.
Vaadin Platform versions before 14.2 generates `package.json` file with `@vaadin/flow-deps` 
dependency which refers to an additional package located in `target/frontend` folder. 
Starting from Vaadin 14.2 `package.json` will contain all package information and `target/frontend/package.json` referenced by the `@vaadin/flow-deps` dependency does not exist anymore. The `@vaadin/flow-depsdependency` 
should be removed from the `package.json` dependencies for 14.2.
Framework dependency handling uses a `"vaadin"` object inside `package.json` and only touches dependencies named there.

== Switch between NPM and PNPM packaging tools

By default Vaadin Platform 14.2 projects uses `pnpm` tool. It's possible to disable 
`pnpm` and switch back to `npm`. This can be done via `disable.pnpm` property value 
(system property for dev mode is `vaadin.disable.pnpm` or you may use 
servlet init parameter `disable.pnpm`, in production mode system property is `disable.pnpm`)
or `disablePnpm` configuration parameter for maven plugin.

= Switch between NPM and PNPM

Vaadin Platform 15 uses `npm` as the default package manager. It's also possible to switch to https://pnpm.js.org/[pnpm], the benefit of `pnpm` is that it uses a shared repository, which allows reducing packages download time.

To switch to `pnpm` you can use the `pnpm.enable` property, e.g., 

`mvn spring-boot:run -Dpnpm.enable`

To read more about how to set properties, see the <<tutorial-flow-runtime-configuration#, Application runtime configuration documentation>>.

Alternatively, you could also use `pnpmEnable` configuration parameter for maven plugin in the `pom.xml` file
```xml
<configuration>
    <pnpmEnable>true</pnpmEnable>
</configuration>
```

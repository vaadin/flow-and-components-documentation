= Core Concepts

In the following, we go through some concepts central to Vaadin development.

== Rapid Web Application Development

At Vaadin, we pride ourselves on developer productivity.
We feel that developers should be able to forget the framework they run on, so that they can concentrate on developing the best application they can.

For rapid application development, Vaadin offers:

* Customizable project templates in link:https://vaadin.com/start/latest[Get Started with Vaadin]
* link:https://vaadin.com/start/latest[Downloadable application examples]
* Maven archetypes
* https://vaadin.com/eclipse[Eclipse plugin] for rapid project creation
* https://vaadin.com/designer[Vaadin Designer] for interactive UI designing

== Everything is a Component

Vaadin uses a component-based programming model to build UIs.
Reusable components are the cornerstone of Vaadin.
Everything in the UI is a component.
To have a button, you create a button component.
To have a text input field, you create a [classname]#TextField# component.
You can build your own components and views by combining existing components and layouts, or by creating creating a new web component and connecting it with a server-side counterpart.

Each server-side component is connected to web components and HTML elements on the client-side.

The following is a small but complete Vaadin application written in Java:

In the example, the application itself is a UI component that extends one of Vaadin’s basic layouts – [classname]#VerticalLayout#.
In the constructor, we add a [classname]#H1# component (which corresponds to a [elementname]#h1# HTML tag) to the layout to say hello to the entire world.

////
To make it an application, we map the view to an empty route with the `@Route("")` annotation, so when this application is deployed to a local server, the view is available on your machine at `http://localhost:8080/`.

== Event-Driven Programming

To make the applications interactive, Vaadin provides an event-driven programming model.
User interaction causes events, which are handled by event listeners.

In Java code, you can handle button clicks by adding a click listener with [methodname]#addClickListener()#, typically as a lambda expression:

[source, java]
----
Button button = new Button("Push me!");

button.addClickListener(event ->
  button.setText("You pushed me!"));
----

In JavaScript code, you add an event listener to the element:

[source, javascript]
----
const button = document.createElement('vaadin-button');
button.textContent = 'Push me!';
button.addEventListener('click', event => button.textContent = 'You pushed me!');
----

The server-side event and listener classes are illustrated in <<figure.introduction.concepts.events>>.

== Flexible and Powerful Data Binding

All Vaadin components have a clear and unified data binding API to help developers build data-intensive apps with confidence.

== Key Technologies

Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)::
  Vaadin applications are styled using cascading style sheets (CSS).
  Styling begins with a built-in _theme_, which can be modified and refined with application-specific style sheets.
+
See <<../theme/theming-overview#, Theming Applications with CSS>>.

Java Servlets::
  Vaadin applications run as Java servlets.
  A Java Servlet is a class that is executed in a Java web server (a __Servlet
container__) to extend the capabilities of the server.
  In practice, it is normally a part of a __web application__, which can contain HTML pages to provide static content, and JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Java Servlets to provide dynamic content.

= Vaadin Spring Configuration

There are a number of properties that you can use to configure your Flow application.
See e.g. `com.vaadin.server.DeploymentConfiguration`
and `com.vaadin.server.Constants` classes for property names.

You can still set those properties as system properties. But you can also
use Spring properties. The Spring configuration properties have the same 
names but they are prefixed with `"vaadin."`.

=== Special configuration parameters

`blacklisted-packages` is a comma separated string that can be used to blacklist packages from getting scanned in v14
(NPM mode) projects. As the default set of packages doesn't cover everything that we shouldn't be interested in.

.application.properties
[source, properties]
====
vaadin.blacklisted-packages=org/bouncycastle,com/my/db/package
====

== Spring Boot properties

If you use Spring Boot then you can use `application.properties` file for
setting your properties.

E.g. if you want to set URL mapping (which is `/*` by default) you should put
this line into you `application.properties` file.

[source,ini]
----
vaadin.urlMapping=/my_mapping/*
----

[NOTE]
Please note that an additional Servlet is required to handle the frontend resources for non-root servlets, such as /my_mapping/*. The servlet can be defined in your application class, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaadin/flow-and-components-documentation/master/tutorial-servlet-spring-boot/src/main/java/org/vaadin/tutorial/spring/Application.java[see here for an example].

== Configuring Spring Web application

If you don't use Spring Boot and you use `VaadinMVCWebAppInitializer` subclass then 
you should populate somehow your properties by yourself.
You may create a configuration in the following way:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@PropertySource("classpath:application.properties")
public class MyConfiguration {

}
----

The `application.properties` file is used here as well but you may use any name 
and any property source here.
Now you just need to set properties in the `application.properties` file in the same way as above.

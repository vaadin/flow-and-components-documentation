= Theming Overview

[NOTE]
We are planning on improving this section of the documentation in the near future, as it does not necessarily give you all the information you need to use themes and styling effectively. In the meantime, weâ€™ve created a one-page tutorial with the most commonly needed information and resources: https://vaadin.com/tutorials/themes-and-styling-in-vaadin[Themes and styling in Vaadin]

Vaadin uses themes to separate the appearance of an application from its logic.

Themes allow you to customize the look and feel of your application and components. You can use https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/[Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)] files in combination with the `@CssImport` Java annotation to style any content.

In this section we cover:

* <<using-component-themes#,Using Themes>>.
* <<application-theming-basics#,Theming Basics>>.
* <<theming-crash-course#,Theming Web Components>>.
* <<integrating-component-theme#,Integrating a Custom Component Theme>>.
* <<tutorial-theming-overlay#,Theming Overlay Components>>.

[NOTE]
This content does not cover CSS basics. There are many external resources you can use for this purpose, for example https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[MDN].

[NOTE]
If your application includes <<../polymer-templates/tutorial-template-basic#,Polymer templates>>, you need to use <<theming-crash-course#using-style-modules,style modules>> for theming.

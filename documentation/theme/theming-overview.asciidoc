= Theming Overview

Vaadin Flow uses themes to separate the appearance of an application from its logic. 

Themes allow you to customize the look and feel of your application and components. You can use https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/[Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)] or HTML <<theming-crash-course#using-style-modules,style modules>> to style any content.

In this section we cover:

* <<using-component-themes#,Using Themes>>.
* <<application-theming-basics#,Theming Basics>>.
* <<theming-crash-course#,Theming Polymer Components>>.
* <<integrating-component-theme#,Creating a Custom Theme>>.
* <<tutorial-theming-overlay#,Theming Overlay Components>>.

[NOTE]
This content does not cover CSS basics. There are many external resources you can use for this purpose. 

[NOTE]
If your application includes <<../polymer-templates/tutorial-template-basic#,Polymer components>>, you need to use <<theming-crash-course#using-style-modules,style modules>> for theming.

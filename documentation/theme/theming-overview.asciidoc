= Theming Overview

Vaadin Flow uses themes to separate the appearance of an application from its logic. 

Themes allow you to customize the look and feel of your application and components. You can use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) (https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) files in combination with the `@CssImport` java annotation to style any content.

In this section we cover:

* <<using-component-themes#,8.5. _Using Component Themes_>>.
* <<application-theming-basics#,8.1. _Application Theming Basics_>>.
* <<theming-crash-course#,8.3. _Theming Web Components_>>.
* <<integrating-component-theme#,8.2. _Integrating Your Own Component Theme_>>.
* <<tutorial-theming-overlay#,8.6. _Theming components - Overlay_>>.

[NOTE]
This content does not cover CSS basics. There are many external resources you can use for this purpose. 

[NOTE]
If your application includes Polymer components (<<../polymer-templates/tutorial-template-basic#,>>), you need to use style modules for theming. See <<theming-crash-course#,8.3. _Theming Web Components_>> for more.

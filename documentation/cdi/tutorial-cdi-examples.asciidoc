= Getting Started with CDI and Vaadin

A tutorial application which showcases the basic usage of a Vaadin CDI Application is available at https://github.com/vaadin/flow-cdi-tutorial.
You can use this application example to test the different concepts and features presented in the documentation.

For starting a new project with CDI and Vaadin, you can clone the Project Base for Vaadin and CDI (https://github.com/vaadin/skeleton-starter-flow-cdi) repository.
It is a project template with the necessary configuration and dependencies included for starting building you own application.
This starter is also available for download from https://vaadin.com/start, where you can customize the naming (package, project) for it.

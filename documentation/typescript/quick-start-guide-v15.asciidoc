= Quick Start of a clean V15 project

If you already have a working Vaadin-14 maven project, check the <<quick-start-guide-v14#, V14 Migration>> guide.

→ *Step 1* - Create a new project at link:https://start.stg.vaadin.com/[start.stg.vaadin.com^]

[NOTE]
Make sure to select `TypeScript + Spring Boot` as the technology stack.

→ *Step 2* - Unzip an run the project in Dev-Mode

Run `mvn spring-boot:run` in the console and open the application at link:http://localhost:8080[]. After that, all modifications in `frontend` directory are compiled and reloaded automatically. Refreshing browser is enough to get the updates.

[NOTE]
When running the project the very first time, be patient all `maven` and `npm` dependencies need to be downloaded.

[NOTE]
If you'd rather run the spring project from the IDE, first run the maven goal `mvn compile` to prepare the environment.

→ *Step 3* - Add a new client-side view and set a route path for it [[step-3]]

First add a new route for the new view:

.frontend/index.ts
[source, javascript]
----

router.setRoutes([
  ...
  {
    path: '/help',
    component: 'app-help',
    action: () => import('./views/help/app-help')
  },
  ...
]);
----

Second create a new client-side view:

.frontend/views/help/app-help.ts
[source, javascript]
----
import {LitElement, html, customElement} from 'lit-element';

@customElement('app-help')
export class AppHelp extends LitElement {
    render() {
      return html`
        <vaadin-button @click=${this.click}>Read More</vaadin-button>
      `;
    }

    click(e) {
      console.log('clicked');
    }
}
----

→ *Step 4* - Continue with the <<how-to-access-backend-from-typescript#, 'How to Access the Backend from TypeScript'>> guide for consuming server-side services.

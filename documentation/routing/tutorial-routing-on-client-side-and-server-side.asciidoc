= Introduction to Routing in Vaadin

Vaadin applications can be developed with server-side only views, client-side only views, or both at the same time. Therefore Vaadin provides 2 types of routing:

The first one is _Java `@Route`_ annotation and the other one is _TypeScript routing_.

== What is the @Route Annotation?

`@Route` annotaion is used to navigate between server-side views in an application.

When you want to define any Java component as a route target for a URL fragment, let's use it.

We will guide how to use `@Route` annotation in <<tutorial-routing-annotation#,the next chapter>>
and describe other things related to `@Route` annotation in this section.

== TypeScript routing

If you are looking for a way to combine client and server views in an application,
you are in the right place.

TypeScript routing (`@vaadin/router`) allows adding client-side routes, and using them separately or together with server-side routes defined with the `@Route` annotation. You can also use it without server-side views.

We will explain more about `@vaadin/router` how to use it and how it works in <<../typescript/creating-routes#, the Creating UI in TypeScript>> section.

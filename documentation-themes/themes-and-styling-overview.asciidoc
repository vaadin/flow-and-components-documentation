= Overview

Vaadin separates the appearance of the user interface from its logic using themes. Using a theme helps in making an application look and feel consistent to the end user, and offers a shared visual language which you can apply to your application-specific styling.


== Prerequisites

To set a theme for you application, you only need to know a bit of Java or JavaScript.

Themes and application-specific styles are implemented using https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS[Cascading Style Sheets] (CSS).
Style sheets are authored as `.css` files. If you are including style sheets in client-side code they can also be authored as `.js` files (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules[JavaScript modules]).

You should be comfortable writing CSS to be able to effectively customize themes and style components.
The https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS[CSS tutorials on MDN] are a great way to learn the basics of CSS. After that, <<style-scopes#,Style Scopes>> and <<css-custom-properties#,CSS Custom Properties and Variables>> are especially important topics to understand.


== Concepts

Theme::

A theme is a collection of style sheets which are loaded when the application starts.
It defines global font styles and text and background colors.
+
A theme defines the styles of all components and can also affect component behavior.
For example, where the date picker overlay opens on small viewport sizes.
+

Theming::

The term “theming” is used for styles that apply across all style scopes, and in general affect the shared visual aspects of an application.
+
For example, you could choose the primary color, choose a certain font to be used for all components, and apply a certain background color for all buttons across the application.
+
Learn more about <<theming-basics#,Theming Basics>>.

Styling::

The term “styling” is used for styles that apply to particular instances of components.
For example, you could style an individual button in one view to have a different background color than all the other buttons in the app, or increase the cell padding of a data grid in one view.
+
The techniques used for theming and styling are mostly the same.
The main difference is how you scope the CSS: for all instances of a certain component, to certain theme variants, or only to specific component instances.

== Built-in Themes

Vaadin comes with two built-in themes you can use as-is or as the basis for your own customization.

The built-in themes come with:

* Clean typographic hierarchy
* Carefully adjusted spacing of elements in all components
* Animations
* Hundreds of cohesive design decisions
* CSS custom properties and variables for customizing fonts, colors, border radius, and spacing, and to be used as building blocks for application-specific styling.
* Ability to override individual component styles
* Light and dark color palettes


=== Lumo

All Vaadin components implement the Lumo theme by default, which gives your application a coherent and polished look out-of-the-box. In addition to the **dark** palette, which is useful in low-light conditions, Lumo has a built-in **compact** variant. It reduced space between elements, and is useful when you have a lot of data on the display.

See <<../../themes/lumo/lumo-theme-overview#,Lumo>> for more details.


=== Material

The Material theme is an implementation of Google’s https://material.io[Material Design] guidelines.
The guidelines are followed whenever possible, and for features which are not described in the them, we take inspiration and make them fit in seamlessly.

See <<../../themes/material/material-theme-overview#,Material>> for more details.
